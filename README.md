# ASP.NET Core 2 and Angular 5
This is the code repository for [ASP.NET Core 2 and Angular 5](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/aspnet-core-2-and-angular-5?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788293600), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
If you experience any issue while running the project while following the book's Chapter 01, please do the following:
- Get the updated project from GitHub and save it in a separate folder
- Right-click to the `TestMakerFreeWebApp_Chapter_01_Part02` project and ***Set as StartUp Project***
- Execute the `npm-update.bat` and `update-webpack.bat` files
- Launch the project in debug mode
In case it works, compare your code with the GitHub files to see what's wrong. Also be sure to check out the book's errata and other useful info regarding the source code from the [Issues page](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/ASP.NET-Core-2-and-Angular-5/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=).

## About the Book
Full-Stack Web Development means being able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of an application. Front-end is the part the user will see or interact with, while back-end is the underlying engine which handles the logical flow: server configuration, data storage and retrieval, database interactions, user authentication and more. This book will guide the reader to become proficient, if not fluent, in both of these worlds by combining the impressive capabilities of ASP.NET Core 2 and Angular 5.
Get ready to experience a journey of the entire development process using a full-stack approach, from the project setup to the deployment phase: using the ASP.NET MVC Framework to implement the back-end API calls, Entity Framework Core to build the Data Model, then Angular 5 to put together the front-end. You'll be able to take full control of your solution by choosing and configuring the development tools accordingly along with the main architecture. You will then implement the back-end with MVC, APIs, server-side routing and request-response cycle and also implement the front-end with Angular 5. Later on, you will build the Data Model with Entity Framework Core and style the front-end with Bootstrap and CSS/LESS for a responsive, mobile-friendly UI. You will go through Forms and Validation and different Authentication and Authorization techniques, including Third-Party Authentication using OAuth2 providers such as Facebook. At the end, you will go through the final steps of Deployment using Windows Server, SQL Server, and the IIS/Kestrel reverse proxy.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
    selector: "pagenotfound",
    templateUrl: "./pagenotfound.component.html"
})

export class PageNotFoundComponent {
    title = "Page not Found";
}
```
